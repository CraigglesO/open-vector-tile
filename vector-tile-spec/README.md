# Open Vector Tile Specification

A specification for encoding tiled vector data.

## Implementations

* [open-vector-tile](https://github.com/Open-S2/open-vector-tile) (Rust and Typescript)

## Versioning

The specification is versioned based on `major.minor` notation. The `major` version will be incremented with any technical change to the specification format or way it should be interpreted. Changes to the `minor` version will be reserved for any clarification or correction of clerical errors associated with the specification language.

The `major` version in the specification name is synonymous with the `version` field in an Open Vector Tile layer. See the `4.1. Layers` section for more details.
